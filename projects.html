                This year, UCR-UAS is pursuing the development of our system�s full-scale prototype, the Borealis, by the end of the 2020-2021 academic year. This prototype is a precursor towards our competition solution, the Aurora, which is capable of object recognition, autonomous flight, obstacle avoidance, payload delivery, and mapping. This project is driven by the collective efforts of over 50 undergraduate students, each specializing in one of our eight sub-teams. The Borealis is scheduled to be presented at the UCR Aerospace Conference this coming Spring Quarter.
